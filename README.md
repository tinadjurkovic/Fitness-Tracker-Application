# Fitness Tracker Application
Welcome to the Fitness Tracker App, an Angular project designed to empower users on their fitness journey by delivering personalized meal and exercise plans.

## Overview

Users are first asked to provide their information, which lays the basis for a customised workout experience. The next screen that visitors see is an easy-to-use menu with four options: "Lose Weight," "Gain Weight," "Stay Active," and "Strengthen Muscles."

After choosing a fitness goal, customers are taken to a place where their own journey begins. Users are provided with a customised workout plan and meal plan for each goal.

## Features

### 1. Creating a user
Provide some basic information about you to get started. The app makes use of this data to customise your fitness journey, making sure that the tracking and planning are in line with your goals.

### 2. Personalized Plans
Select from four distinct fitness goals, each of which opens up a customised workout and food plans. The Fitness Tracker App adjusts to your goals, whether they are to put on muscle, reduce weight, or remain active.

### 3. Progress Tracking
Use the Tracker feature to quickly record meals and workouts as finished. Easily include monitoring into your daily activities to stay inspired and accountable as you pursue a healthy lifestyle.
